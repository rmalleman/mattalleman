My name is Matt Alleman. I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah and am studying computer science at Weber State University.  

I've wanted to set up something to document my life and projects I'm working for quite sometime, but never got around to it until now.  I'm not really sure how often I'll end up updating, but hopefully on a somewhat regular basis.

If you would like to get in contact with me feel free to email me or reach me via twitter.
    
Regards,<br /> 
Matt Alleman
